# Image Generation and LoRA Service with Flux

## Development log

This is a log of coding work I did while working at a startup.

The CTO and I cooperated to create a web service that not only provides image geneartion services like Midjourney but also enables users to fine-tune and use LoRA for Flux.

We tried to build this service by using the Flux API and to deploy it with Replit.

My role was to modify the backend structure on Replit with Stripe and Firestore.

Unfortunately, this project was halted.
